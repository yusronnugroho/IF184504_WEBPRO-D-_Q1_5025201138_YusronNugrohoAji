          <p>Let the sea set you free, Nothing soothes the soul like a day by the water, You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to leave the shore. Dear ocean, Thank you for making us feel tiny, salty, humble and inspired, all at once, High tides and good vibe.The ocean's roar is music to the soul, Saltwater cures all wound. You can find me where the sand meets the wate, If there's a will, there's a wave, We dream in colors borrowed from the sea.</p>

          <p>A waterfall is a point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.Humans have had a distinct relationship with waterfalls for years, travelling to see them, exploring and naming them. They can present formidable barriers to navigation along rivers. Waterfalls are religious sites in many cultures and some certains community.</p>

          <h2>Feel Nature.<br><span>Relax</span></h2>
          <p>Scientists have been dealing with the question of how nature affects the psyche of us humans for decades. The answer is always the same: nature is good for us. Numerous studies have measured how, for example, the stress hormone cortisol, blood pressure, and pulse rate drop when we spend a certain amount of time in nature. In some cases, 20-30 minutes are enough to reduce stress, improve concentration and lift the mood. We can only really relax when we have a certain distance from our everyday routine.</p>
